The main file is the project.cpp file. I included a makefile with the commands make and make clean. 
If you would like to test this code please refer to the file project.pdf. The files we were required to use
were the EMPLOYEE.csv, PROJECT.csv, and the TAB_COLUMNS.csv files. However I also included a couple more files for extra testing purposes.
